# CHANGELOG

The changelog for `acc-pack-common` iOS.

--------------------------------------

2.0.0
-----

### Enhancements
- Remove shared instance so developers can control it.

1.3.0
-----

### Enhancements

- Introduce `isRemoteAudioAvailable` and `isRemoteVideoAvailable` to have more audio and video control.

### Fixes

- Use `#import <objc/runtime.h>` instead of `#import <objc/objc-runtime.h>` to solve compilation error.
- Fix a crash that `NSMutableSet` can't remove `nil`.

1.2.4
-----

### Enhancements

- Nil out `publisherView` and `subscriberView` in `disconnect` method for avoiding potential side effect.

1.2.3
-----

### Enhancements

- Nil out `publisher` and `subscriber` in `disconnect` method for avoiding potential side effect.

1.2.2
-----

### Enhancements

- Add `subscribeToStreamWithStreamId:` for switching to another stream.


1.2.1
-----

### Enhancements

- Add `subscriberVideoContentMode` for displaying a fit or fill video.
- Add `subscribeToStreamWithName:` for switching to another stream.
- Make sure that the publisher has a name.

### Fixes

- Perform un-subscription and do subscription if there are any new streams being created. This will ensure that the session does not hold extra unused subscribers.

-----

### Enhancements

- Update OpenTok iOS SDK dependency to 2.9.1 (https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/release-notes.html)

------

### Enhancements

- Enhance documentation.
- Remove connection related methods as it's unnecessary.

1.1.8
-----

### Enhancements

- Add documentation

### Breaking changes

- Remove `setOpenTokApiKey:sessionId:token:` from OTOneToOneCommunicator. Instead, force to use the one from `OTAcceleratorSession` to avoid redundancy.

1.1.5
-----

### Enhancements

- Now you can add a name to your publisher by setting `publisherName` property.
- Now `connect` and `disconnect` will return an immediate `NSError` object to indicate pre-connection errors.
- The block handler of `connectWithHandler:` is required now.

1.1.0
-----

### Breaking changes
